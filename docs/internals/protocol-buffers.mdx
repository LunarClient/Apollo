# Protocol Buffers

## Overview

Apollo uses Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) to communicate with the client.

* The generated artifacts are available on our [Maven repository](/maven-repository) as `com.lunarclient:apollo-protos`
* The underlying `.proto` definitions are available on Buf Schema Registry, at https://buf.build/lunarclient/apollo

Note that although the `.proto` files / messages _generally_ match up with Apollo modules, there are circumstances where we
expose different interfaces in Apollo -- primarily to make the API simpler to use.

For example, Apollo's `modsetting` and `serverrule` module end up flowing over the wire as the same packet. However, we split them into separate modules (with separate purposes) in the public API.

## Contributions

As all changes to the `.proto` definitions require a corresponding implementation in the client to be usable, we aren't currently allowing direct contributions to `.proto` files.

## Support

The usage of protocol buffers, and the generated code itself, is considered an implementation detail of Apollo. As such, we can only provide limited support to those
wishing to use protocol buffers directly.
