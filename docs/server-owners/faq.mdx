The legacy API was hastily created specifically for features Lunar Network needed.
Whereas, Apollo was created with the intention to add more general functionality for all types of servers and gamemodes.

<summary>Can I continue to use the legacy Lunar Client API?</summary>

Yes, as of now you're able to keep using the legacy Lunar Client API.
However, we no longer recommend the legacy API, and you won't be able to use the newest features added to Apollo.
We will eventually discontinue support for the legacy API, so it's highly recommended updating to use Apollo.
