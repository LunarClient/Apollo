<summary>Can I continue to use the legacy Lunar Client API?</summary>

Yes, as of now you're able to keep using the legacy Lunar Client API.
However, we're no longer maintaining the legacy API, which means you won't be able to use the newest features.
We will evenly discontinue support for the legacy API support, so it's highly recommended updating to use Apollo.
