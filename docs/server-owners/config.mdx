# Configuration

The Apollo configurations are split into two parts:
  * General and module specific settings for Apollo are located in the `config.yml`.
  * Settings for Lunar Client mod options are located in the `mods.yml`.

The settings for the `config.yml` are generated with examples and comments, which you can modify to your liking.

The `mods.yml` is not generated with its settings or comments, which will require you to refer to each mods documentation ([example](apollo/developers/mods/2ditems#available-options)) for the keys and value(s) you can set.
The settings in the `mods.yml` will override the mod options for players on Lunar Client while they are on your server and revert them back after they leave.
