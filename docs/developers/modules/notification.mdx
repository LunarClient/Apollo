# Notification Module

## Overview

The notification module allows you to send Lunar Client notifications to players actively on your server.

* Send custom notifications to Lunar Client players.
  * Custom notification color can be provided.
  * Custom icons can be provided.

## Integration

### `Notification` Builder

#### Sample Code

```java
private final Notification notification = Notification.builder()
    .title("UHC Announcement")
    .description("UHC starts in 5 minutes...")
    .resourceLocation("icons/golden_apple.png") // This field is optional
    .build();
```

#### `Notifcation` Options


`.title(String)` is the title of the notification box. Char limit: `15`

{/* Find out char limit & add screenshot of notification w/ title highlighted */}

```java
.title("UHC Announcement")
```

`.description(String)` is the description displayed inside the notification box. Char limit: `15`

{/* Find out char limit & add screenshot of notification w/ desc highlighted */}

```java
.description("UHC starts in 5 minutes...")
```

`.icon(SimpleResourceLocationIcon)` is how you set an icon on the notification, this field is **optional**. See the [icons utilities page](/apollo/developers/utilities/icons) to learn more about icons.

```java

```

If this field is left empty (null) it'll display a generic info icon, as displayed here.

{/* insert screenshot of generic info icon */}

### Displaying a Notification for a specific player

#### Sample Code

```java
public void displayNotificationExample(Player viewer) {
    Optional<ApolloPlayer> apolloPlayerOpt = Apollo.getPlayerManager().getPlayer(viewer.getUniqueId());
    
    // Sending the notifcation built by the notifcation builder example above, "uhcAnnouncement", to the player.
    apolloPlayerOpt.ifPresent(apolloPlayer -> this.notificationModule.displayNotification(apolloPlayer, this.uhcAnnouncement));
}
```

### Broadcasting a notification for an entire server

#### Sample Code

```java

```
