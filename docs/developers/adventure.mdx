# Adventure

Adventure is used throughout Apollo to send text from various modules to the client and more.
Refer to the official [Adventure documentation](https://docs.advntr.dev) for further information on how to use it.

## Integration

The Adventure platform is added dynamically to the server if it doesn't exist already. You do not need to shade in Adventure yourself.

You may wish to depend on the [Apollo Adventure artifact](/maven-repository#apollo-dependencies) to target the exact version of Adventure it is using.
